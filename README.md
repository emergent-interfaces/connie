An open-source web application for managing large conventions using rules based design.

Development
-----------
Use `rake db:seed` to populate the development database with core data required by the
application as well as some example data which makes the site interesting to browse.  These
operations can be performed separately via `rake db:seed:core` and `rake db:seed:examples`.
