  convention_authorization:
    description: |
      Authorizations restrict access of sensitive data based on roles in a convention.  Every user is linked to a
      a profile, and this profile can have various roles in any number of conventions.  Each role that a profile
      has in a convention can give him or her rights to view, create, or manipulate data for the convention.  The
      rights that each role provides are set specifying authorized roles in the following manner:

  formtastic:
    hints:
      convention:
        name: "Unique identifier for this convention"
      time_span:
        confidence: "How confident you are that these will be the actual times"
      auth_requirement:
        requirement:
          A comma seperated list of the roles that can perform the action on the object
          in this convention.  A role is specified in the form "department:role-name".
          These should match roles you have assigned to profiles for this convention.
          The "*" character can be used to match all (or none-specified).  The requirement
          "*:*" matches all roles in all departments in the convention.
